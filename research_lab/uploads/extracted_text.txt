Preface
This text is designed to introduce undergraduates at the junior and senior levels to quantum mechan-
ics. The text is an outgrowth of the new physics major curriculum developed by the Paradigms in 
Physics program at Oregon State University. This new curriculum distributes material from the sub-
disciplines throughout the two upper-division years and provides students with a more gradual tran-
sition between introductory and advanced levels. We have also incorporated and developed modern 
pedagogical strategies to help improve student learning. This text covers the quantum mechanical 
aspects of our curriculum in a way that can also be used in traditional curricula, but that still pre-
serves the advantages of the Paradigms approach to the ordering of materials and the use of student 
engagement activities.
PARADIGMS PROGRAM
The Paradigms project began in 1997, when the Department of Physics at Oregon State University 
began an extensive revision of the upper-division physics major. In an effort to encourage students 
to draw connections between the subdisciplines of physics, the structure of the Paradigms has been 
crafted to mimic the organization of expert physics knowledge. Students are presented with a model 
of how physicists organize their understanding of physical phenomena and problem solving. Each 
of the nine short junior-year Paradigms courses focuses on a speciﬁc paradigm or class of physics 
problems that serves as the centerpiece of the course and on which different tools and skills are built. 
In the senior year, students resume a more traditional curriculum, taking six capstone courses in 
the traditional disciplines. This curriculum incorporates a diverse set of student activities that allow 
students to stay actively engaged in the classroom and to work together in constructing their under-
standing of physics. Computer resources are used frequently to help students visualize the systems 
they are studying.
CONTENT AND APPROACH
Quantum mechanics is integrated into four of the junior-year Paradigms courses and one senior-year 
capstone course at Oregon State University. This text includes all the quantum mechanics topics 
covered in those ﬁve courses. We adopt a “spins-ﬁrst” approach by introducing quantum mechanics 
through the analysis of sequential Stern-Gerlach spin measurements. This approach is based upon 
previous presentations of spin systems by Feynman, Leighton, and Sands; Cohen-Tannoudji, Diu, 
and Laloe; Sakurai; and Townsend. The aim of the spins-ﬁrst approach is twofold: (1) To imme-
diately immerse students in the inherently quantum mechanical aspects of physics by focusing on 
simple measurements that have no classical explanation, and (2) To give students early and extensive 
experience with the mechanics of quantum mechanics in the forms of Dirac and matrix notation. 

xvi Preface 
The  simplicity of the spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems allows the students to focus on these new features, 
which run counter to classical mechanics.
The ﬁrst three chapters of this text deal exclusively with spin systems and extensions to general 
two- and three-state quantum mechanical systems. The basic postulates of quantum mechanics are 
illustrated through their manifestation in the Stern-Gerlach experiments. After these three chapters, 
students have the tools to tackle any quantum mechanical problem presented in Dirac or matrix 
notation. After a brief interlude into quantum spookiness (the EPR Paradox and Schrödinger’s cat) 
in Chapter 4, we tackle the traditional wave function aspects of quantum mechanics. We present 
several quantum systems—a particle in a box, on a ring, on a sphere, the hydrogen atom, and the 
harmonic oscillator—and emphasize their common features and their connections to the basic pos-
tulates. The differential equations of angular momentum and the hydrogen atom radial problem are 
solved in detail to expose students to the rigor of series solutions, though we stress that these are 
again eigenvalue equations, no different in principle from the spin eigenvalue equations. Whenever 
possible, we continue the use of Dirac notation and matrix notation learned in the spin chapters, 
emphasizing the importance of ﬂuency in multiple representations. We build upon the spins-ﬁrst 
approach by using the spin-1/2 example to introduce perturbation theory, the addition of angular 
momentum, and identical particles.

AUDIENCE AND EXPECTED BACKGROUND
The intended audience is junior and senior physics majors, who are expected to have taken intermediate-
level courses in modern physics and linear algebra. No other upper-level physics or mathematics courses 
are required. For our own students, we review matrix algebra in a seven contact hour “preface” course 
that precedes the Paradigms courses that teach quantum mechanics. The material for that preface course 
is in Appendix C. The material in Appendix B summarizes an earlier Paradigms course on oscillations, 
and the material in Appendix D summarizes the classical wave part of the Paradigms course on waves.
STUDENT ACTIVITIES AND WEBSITE
Student engagement activities are an integral part of the Paradigms curriculum. All of the activities 
that we have developed are freely available on our wiki website:
http://physics.oregonstate.edu/portfolioswiki
The wiki contains a wealth of information about the Paradigms project, the courses we teach, and the 
materials we have developed. Details about individual activities include descriptions, student handouts, 
instructor’s guides, advice about how to use active engagement strategies, videos of classroom prac-
tice, narratives of classroom activities, and comments from users—both internal and external to Oregon 
State University. This is a dynamic website that is continually updated as we develop new activities and 
improve existing ones. We encourage you to visit the website and join the community. E-mail us with 
corrections, additions, and suggestions.
Each of the quantum mechanics activities that we use in our ﬁve courses is referenced in the 
resource section at the end of the appropriate chapter in the text. The quantum mechanics activities are 
collected within the wiki website with a direct link: 
www.physics.oregonstate.edu/qmactivities 
These activities include different types of activities such as computer-based activities, group activities, 
and class response activities. The most extensive activity is a computer simulation of Stern-Gerlach 
experiments. This SPINS software is a full-featured, menu-driven application that allows students to 
simulate successive Stern-Gerlach measurements and explore incompatible observables, eigenstate 
expansions, interference, and quantum dynamics. The use of the SPINS software facilitates our spins-
ﬁrst approach. The beauty of the simulation is that students steeped in classical physics perform a foun-
dational quantum experiment and learn the most fascinating and counterintuitive aspects of quantum 
mechanics at an early stage.

Prologue
It was a dark and stormy night. Erwin huddled under his covers as he had done numerous times that 
summer. As the wind and rain lashed at the window, he feared having to retreat to the storm cellar 
once again. The residents of Erwin’s apartment building sought shelter whenever there were threats of 
tornadoes in the area. While it was safe down there, Erwin feared the ridicule he would face once again 
from the other school boys. In the rush to the cellar, Erwin seemed to always end up with a random 
pair of socks, and the other boys teased him about it mercilessly.
Not that Erwin hadn’t tried hard to solve this problem. He had a very simple collection of 
socks—black or white, for either school or play; short or long, for either trousers or lederhosen. 
After the ﬁrst few teasing episodes from the other boys, Erwin had sorted his socks into two sepa-
rate drawers. He placed all the black socks in one drawer and all the white socks in another drawer. 
Erwin ﬁgured he could determine an individual sock’s length in the dark of night simply by feel-
ing it, but he had to have them presorted into white and black because the apartment generally lost 
power before the call to the shelter.
Unfortunately, Erwin found that this presorting of the socks by color was ineffective. Whenever 
he reached into the white sock drawer and chose two long socks, or two short socks, there was a 50% 
probability of any one sock being black or white. The results from the black sock drawer were the 
same. The socks seemed to have “forgotten” the color that Erwin had determined previously.
Erwin also tried sorting the socks into two drawers based upon their length, without regard to 
color. When he chose black or white socks from these long and short drawers, the socks had also “for-
gotten” whether they were long or short.
After these fruitless attempts to solve his problem through experiments, Erwin decided to save 
himself the fashion embarrassment, and he replaced his sock collection with a set of medium length 
brown socks. However, he continued to ponder the mysteries of the socks throughout his childhood.
After many years of daydreaming about the mystery socks, Erwin Schrödinger proposed his the-
ory of “Quantum Socks” and become famous. And that is the beginning of the story of the quantum 
socks.
The End.
Farfetched?? You bet. But Erwin’s adventure with his socks is the way quantum mechanics works.

CHAPTER  
1 Stern-Gerlach Experiments
It was not a dark and stormy night when Otto Stern and Walther  Gerlach performed their now famous 
experiment in 1922. The Stern-Gerlach experiment demonstrated that measurements on microscopic 
or quantum particles are not always as certain as we might expect. Quantum particles behave as mys-
teriously as Erwin’s socks—sometimes forgetting what we have already measured. Erwin’s adven-
ture with the mystery socks is farfetched because you know that everyday objects do not behave like 
his socks. If you observe a sock to be black, it remains black no matter what other properties of the 
sock you observe. However, the Stern- Gerlach experiment goes against these ideas. Microscopic or 
quantum particles do not behave like the classical objects of your everyday experience. The act of 
observing a quantum particle affects its measurable properties in a way that is foreign to our classical 
experience.
In these ﬁrst three chapters, we focus on the Stern-Gerlach experiment because it is a conceptu-
ally simple experiment that demonstrates many basic principles of quantum mechanics. We discuss 
a variety of experimental results and the quantum theory that has been developed to predict those 
results. The mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics is based upon six postulates that we will 
introduce as we develop the theoretical framework. (A complete list of these postulates is in Section 1.5.) 
We use the Stern-Gerlach experiment to learn about quantum mechanics theory for two primary reasons: 
(1) It demonstrates how quantum mechanics works in principle by illustrating the postulates of quan-
tum mechanics, and (2) it demonstrates how quantum mechanics works in practice through the use 
of Dirac notation and matrix mechanics to solve problems. By using a simple example, we can focus 
on the principles and the new mathematics, rather than having the complexity of the physics obscure 
these new aspects.
1.1 /H17039 STERN-GERLACH EXPERIMENT
In 1922 Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach performed a seminal experiment in the history of quantum 
mechanics. In its simplest form, the experiment consisted of an oven that produced a beam of neu-
tral atoms, a region of space with an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, and a detector for the atoms, as 
depicted in Fig. 1.1. Stern and Gerlach used a beam of silver atoms and found that the beam was split 
into two in its passage through the magnetic ﬁeld. One beam was deﬂected upwards and one down-
wards in relation to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient.
To understand why this result is so at odds with our classical expectations, we must ﬁrst analyze 
the experiment classically. The results of the experiment suggest an interaction between a neutral parti-
cle and a magnetic ﬁeld. We expect such an interaction if the particle possesses a magnetic moment M.
The potential energy of this interaction is E = -M~B, which results in a force F = /H116121M~B2. In the 

2 Stern-Gerlach Experiments
Stern-Gerlach experiment, the magnetic ﬁeld gradient is primarily in the z-direction, and the resulting 
z-component of the force is
  Fz = 0
0z  1M~B2 
(1.1)
  /H11061mz 
0Bz
0z  . 
This force is perpendicular to the direction of motion and deﬂects the beam in proportion to the com-
ponent of the magnetic moment in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient.
Now consider how to understand the origin of the atom’s magnetic moment from a classical view-
point. The atom consists of charged particles, which, if in motion, can produce loops of current that give 
rise to magnetic moments. A loop of area A and current I produces a magnetic moment
 m = IA (1.2)
in MKS units. If this loop of current arises from a charge q traveling at speed v in a circle of radius r, 
then
  m = q
2pr>v pr2 
  = qrv
2  (1.3)
  = q
2m L , 
where L = mrv is the orbital angular momentum of the particle. In the same way that the earth 
revolves around the sun and rotates around its own axis, we can also imagine a charged particle in 
an atom having orbital angular momentum  L and a new property, the intrinsic angular momen-
tum, which we label S and call spin. The intrinsic angular momentum also creates current loops, 
so we expect a similar relation between the magnetic moment M and S. The exact calculation

particles along the z-axis. The magnet cross section at right shows the inhomogeneous 
ﬁeld used in the experiment.

1.1 Stern-Gerlach Experiment 3
involves an integral over the charge distribution, which we will not do. We simply assume that we 
can relate the magnetic moment to the intrinsic angular momentum in the same fashion as Eq. (1.3), 
giving
 M = g q
2m S , (1.4)
where the dimensionless gyroscopic ratio g contains the details of that integral.
A silver atom has 47 electrons, 47 protons, and 60 or 62 neutrons (for the most common isotopes). 
The magnetic moments depend on the inverse of the particle mass, so we expect the heavy protons and 
neutrons (/H110152000 me) to have little effect on the magnetic moment of the atom and so we neglect them. 
From your study of the periodic table in chemistry, you recall that silver has an electronic conﬁgura-
tion 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p64d105s1, which means that there is only the lone 5 s electron outside 
of the closed shells. The electrons in the closed shells can be represented by a spherically symmetric 
cloud with no orbital or intrinsic angular momentum (unfortunately we are injecting some quantum 
mechanical knowledge of atomic physics into this classical discussion). That leaves the lone 5 s elec-
tron as a contributor to the magnetic moment of the atom as a whole. An electron in an s state has no 
orbital angular momentum, but it does have spin. Hence the magnetic moment of this electron, and 
therefore of the entire neutral silver atom, is
 M = -g
 e
2me
 S , (1.5)
where e is the magnitude of the electron charge. The classical force on the atom can now be written as
 Fz /H11061-g e
2me
 Sz 
0Bz
0z  . (1.6)
The deﬂection of the beam in the Stern-Gerlach experiment is thus a measure of the component (or pro-
jection) Sz of the spin along the z-axis, which is the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient.
If we assume that the 5s electron of each atom has the same magnitude 0S 0 of the intrinsic angular 
momentum or spin, then classically we would write the z-component as Sz = 0S 0cos u, where u is 
the angle between the z-axis and the direction of the spin S. In the thermal environment of the oven, 
we expect a random distribution of spin directions and hence all possible angles u. Thus we expect 
some continuous distribution (the details are not important) of spin components from Sz = - 0S 0 to  
Sz = + 0S 0, which would yield a continuous spread in deﬂections of the silver atomic beam. Rather, 
the experimental result that Stern and Gerlach observed was that there are only two deﬂections, indi-
cating that there are only two possible values of the z-component of the electron spin. The magnitudes 
of these deﬂections are consistent with values of the spin component of
 Sz = {U
2 ,  (1.7)
where U is Planck’s constant h divided by 2p and has the numerical value
  U= 1.0546 * 10- 34  J~s 
  = 6.5821 * 10- 16  eV~s.  
(1.8)
This result of the Stern-Gerlach experiment is evidence of the quantization  of the electron’s 
spin angular momentum component along an axis. This quantization is at odds with our classical 

4 Stern-Gerlach Experiments
expectations for this measurement. The factor of 1/2 in Eq. (1.7) leads us to refer to this as a 
spin-1/2 system.
In this example, we have chosen the z-axis along which to measure the spin component, but there 
is nothing special about this direction in space. We could have chosen any other axis and we would 
have obtained the same results.
Now that we know the ﬁne details of the Stern-Gerlach experiment, we simplify the experiment 
for the rest of our discussions by focusing on the essential features. A simpliﬁed schematic representa-
tion of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1.2, which depicts an oven that produces the beam of atoms, a 
Stern-Gerlach device with two output ports for the two possible values of the spin component, and two 
counters to detect the atoms leaving the output ports of the Stern-Gerlach device. The Stern-Gerlach 
device is labeled with the axis along which the magnetic ﬁeld is oriented. The up and down arrows 
indicate the two possible measurement results for the device; they correspond respectively to the 
results S
z = {U>2 in the case where the ﬁeld is oriented along the z-axis. There are only two possible 
results in this case, so they are generally referred to as spin up and spin down. The physical quantity 
that is measured, Sz in this case, is called an observable. In our detailed discussion of the experiment 
above, we chose the ﬁeld gradient in such a manner that the spin up states were deﬂected upwards. 
In this new simpliﬁcation, the deﬂection itself is not an important issue. We simply label the output 
port with the desired state and count the particles leaving that port. The Stern-Gerlach device sorts 
(or ﬁlters, selects or analyzes) the incoming particles into the two possible outputs S
z = {U>2 in the 
same way that Erwin sorted his socks according to color or length. We follow convention and refer to 
a Stern-Gerlach device as an analyzer.
In Fig. 1.2, the input and output beams are labeled with a new symbol called a ket. We use the 
ket 
0 +9 as a mathematical representation of the quantum state of the atoms that exit the upper port 
corresponding to Sz = +U>2. The lower output beam is labeled with the ket 0 -9, which corresponds 
to Sz = -U>2, and the input beam is labeled with the more generic ket 0 c9. The kets are representa-
tions of the quantum states. They are used in mathematical expressions and they represent all the 
information that we can know about the state. This ket notation was developed by Paul A. M. Dirac 
and is central to the approach to quantum mechanics that we take in this text. We will discuss the 
mathematics of these kets in full detail later. With regard to notation, you will ﬁnd many different 
ways of writing the same ket. The symbol within the ket brackets is any simple label to distinguish 
the ket from other different kets. For example, the kets 
0 +9, 0 +U>29, 0Sz = +U>29, 0 +zn9, and 0c 9 
are all equivalent ways of writing the same thing, which in this case signiﬁes that we have measured 
the z-component of the spin and found it to be +U>2 or spin up. Though we may label these kets in 
different ways, they all refer to the same physical state and so they all behave the same mathemati-
cally. The symbol 
0{9 refers to both the 0 +9 and 0 -9 kets. The ﬁrst postulate of quantum mechanics 
tells us that kets in general describe the quantum state mathematically and that they contain all the 
information that we can know about the state. We denote a general ket as 0 c9.

1.1 Stern-Gerlach Experiment 5
Postulate 1
The state of a quantum mechanical system, including all the information you 
can know about it, is represented mathematically by a normalized ket 0 c9.
We have chosen the particular simpliﬁed schematic representation of the Stern-Gerlach 
experiment shown in Fig. 1.2, because it is the same representation used in the SPINS software 
program that you may use to simulate these experiments. The SPINS program allows you to per-
form all the experiments described in this text. This software is freely available, as detailed in 
Resources at the end of the chapter. In the SPINS program, the components are connected with 
simple lines to represent the paths the atoms take. The directions and magnitudes of deﬂections 
of the beams in the program are not relevant. That is, whether the spin up output beam is drawn 
as deﬂected upwards, downwards, or not at all, is not relevant. The labeling on the output port is 
enough to tell us what that state is. Thus the extra ket label 
0 +9 on the spin up output beam in Fig. 
1.2 is redundant and will be dropped soon.
The SPINS program permits alignment of Stern-Gerlach analyzing devices along all three axes 
and also at any angle f measured from the x-axis in the x-y plane. This would appear to be difﬁcult, if 
not impossible, given that the atomic beam in Fig. 1.1 is directed along the y-axis, making it unclear 
how to align the magnet in the y-direction and measure a deﬂection. In our depiction and discussion of 
Stern-Gerlach experiments, we ignore this technical complication.
In the SPINS program, as in real Stern-Gerlach experiments, the numbers of atoms detected 
in particular states can be predicted by probability rules that we will discuss later. To simplify 
our schematic depictions of Stern-Gerlach experiments, the numbers shown for detected atoms 
are those obtained by using the calculated probabilities without any regard to possible statistical 
uncertainties. That is, if the theoretically predicted probabilities of two measurement possibilities 
are each 50%, then our schematics will display equal numbers for those two possibilities, whereas 
in a real experiment, statistical uncertainties might yield a 55% >45% split in one experiment and 
a 47% >53% split in another, etc. The SPINS program simulations are designed to give statistical 
uncertainties, so you will need to perform enough experiments to convince yourself that you have a 
sufﬁciently good estimate of the probability (see SPINS Lab 1 for more information on statistics).
Now let’s consider a series of simple Stern-Gerlach experiments with slight variations that help to 
illustrate the main features of quantum mechanics. We ﬁrst describe the experiments and their results 
and draw some qualitative conclusions about the nature of quantum mechanics. Then we introduce the 
formal mathematics of the ket notation and show how it can be used to predict the results of each of 
the experiments.
1.1.1 /H17039 Experiment 1
The ﬁrst experiment is shown in Fig. 1.3 and consists of a source of atoms, two Stern-Gerlach ana-
lyzers both aligned along the z-axis, and counters for the output ports of the analyzers. The atomic 
beam coming into the ﬁrst Stern-Gerlach analyzer is split into two beams at the output, just like the 
original experiment. Now instead of counting the atoms in the upper output beam, the spin compo-
nent is measured again by directing those atoms into the second Stern-Gerlach analyzer. The result of 
this experiment is that no atoms are ever detected coming out of the lower output port of the second 
Stern-Gerlach analyzer. All atoms that are output from the upper port of the ﬁrst analyzer also pass 

6 Stern-Gerlach Experiments
through the upper port of the second analyzer. Thus we say that when the ﬁrst Stern-Gerlach analyzer 
measures an atom to have a z-component of spin Sz = +U>2, then the second analyzer also measures 
Sz = +U>2 for that atom. This result is not surprising, but it sets the stage for results of experiments 
to follow.
Though both Stern-Gerlach analyzers in Experiment 1 are identical, they play different roles in 
this experiment. The ﬁrst analyzer prepares the beam in a particular quantum state 10 +92 and the 
second analyzer measures the resultant beam, so we often refer to the ﬁrst analyzer as a state prepa-
ration device. By preparing the state with the ﬁrst analyzer, the details of the source of atoms can be 
ignored. Thus our main focus in Experiment 1 is what happens at the second analyzer because we 
know that any atom entering the second analyzer is represented by the 0 +9 ket prepared by the ﬁrst 
analyzer. All the experiments we will describe employ a ﬁrst analyzer as a state preparation device, 
though the SPINS program has a feature where the state of the atoms coming from the oven is deter-
mined but unknown, and the user can perform experiments to determine the unknown state using only 
one analyzer in the experiment.
1.1.2 /H17039 Experiment 2
The second experiment is shown in Fig. 1.4 and is identical to Experiment 1 except that the sec-
ond Stern-Gerlach analyzer has been rotated by 90° to be aligned with the x-axis. Now the second 
analyzer measures the spin component along the x-axis rather the z-axis. Atoms input to the second 
analyzer are still represented by the ket 0 +9 because the ﬁrst analyzer is unchanged. The result of this 
experiment is that atoms appear at both possible output ports of the second analyzer. Atoms leaving 
the upper port of the second analyzer have been measured to have Sx = +U>2, and atoms leaving

the lower port have Sx = -U>2. On average, each of these ports has 50% of the atoms that left the 
upper port of the ﬁrst analyzer. As shown in Fig. 1.4, the output states of the second analyzer have 
new labels 
0 +9x and 0 -9x, where the x subscript denotes that the spin component has been measured 
along the x-axis. We assume that if no subscript is present on the quantum ket 1e.g., 0 +92, then the 
spin component is along the z-axis. This use of the z-axis as the default is a common convention 
throughout our work and also in much of physics.
A few items are noteworthy about this experiment. First, we notice that there are still only two 
possible outputs of the second Stern-Gerlach analyzer. The fact that it is aligned along a different axis 
doesn’t affect the fact that we get only two possible results for the case of a spin-1/2 particle. Second, 
it turns out that the results of this experiment would be unchanged if we used the lower port of the ﬁrst 
analyzer. That is, atoms entering the second analyzer in state 
0 -9 would also result in half the atoms 
in each of the 0{9x output ports. Finally, we cannot predict which of the second analyzer output ports 
any particular atom will come out. This can be demonstrated in actual experiments by recording the 
individual counts out of each port. The arrival sequences at any counter are completely random. We 
can say only that there is a 50% probability that an atom from the second analyzer will exit the upper 
analyzer port and a 50% probability that it will exit the lower port. The random arrival of atoms at the 
detectors can be seen clearly in the SPINS program simulations.
This probabilistic nature is at the heart of quantum mechanics. One might be tempted to say that 
we just don’t know enough about the system to predict which port the atom will exit. That is to say, 
there may be some other variables, of which we are ignorant, that would allow us to predict the results. 
Such a viewpoint is known as a local hidden variable theory. John Bell proved that such theories are 
not compatible with the experimental results of quantum mechanics. The conclusion to draw from this 
is that even though quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory, it is a complete description of reality. 
We will have more to say about this in Chapter 4.
Note that the 50% probability referred to above is the probability that an atom input to the second 
analyzer exits one particular output port. It is not the probability for an atom to pass through the whole sys-
tem of Stern-Gerlach analyzers. It turns out that the results of this experiment (the 50>50 split at the sec-
ond analyzer) are the same for any combination of two orthogonal axes of the ﬁrst and second analyzers.
1.1.3 /H17039 Experiment 3
Experiment 3, shown in Fig. 1.5, extends Experiment 2 by adding a third Stern-Gerlach analyzer aligned 
along the z-axis. Atoms entering the third analyzer have been measured by the ﬁrst Stern-Gerlach 
analyzer to have spin component up along the z-axis, and by the second analyzer to have spin component 
up along the x-axis. The third analyzer then measures how many atoms have spin component up or down

along the z-axis. Classically, one would expect that the ﬁnal measurement would yield the result spin 
up along the z-axis, because that was measured at the ﬁrst analyzer. That is to say: classically the ﬁrst 
two analyzers tell us that the atoms have Sz = +U>2 and Sx = +U>2, so the third measurement must 
yield Sz = +U>2. But that doesn’t happen, as Erwin learned with his quantum socks in the Prologue. 
The quantum mechanical result is that the atoms are split with 50% probability into each output port at 
the third analyzer. Thus the last two analyzers behave like the two analyzers of Experiment 2 (except 
with the order reversed), and the fact that there was an initial measurement that yielded S
z = +U>2 is 
somehow forgotten or erased.
This result demonstrates another key feature of quantum mechanics: a measurement disturbs the 
system. The second analyzer has disturbed the system such that the spin component along the z-axis 
does not have a unique value, even though we measured it with the ﬁrst analyzer. Erwin saw this 
when he sorted, or measured, his socks by color and then by length. When he looked, or measured, 
a third time, he found that the color he had measured originally was now random—the socks had 
forgotten about the ﬁrst measurement. One might ask: Can I be more clever in designing the experi-
ment such that I don’t disturb the system? The short answer is no. There is a fundamental incompat-
ibility in trying to measure the spin component of the atom along two different directions. So we say 
that S
x and Sz are incompatible observables. We cannot know the measured values of both simul-
taneously. The state of the system can be represented by the ket 0 +9= 0Sz = +U>29 or by the ket 
0 +9x = 0Sx = +U>29, but it cannot be represented by a ket 0Sz = +U>2, Sx = +U>29 that speciﬁes 
values of both components. Having said this, it should be said that not all pairs of quantum mechanical 
observables are incompatible. It is possible to do some experiments without disturbing some of the 
other aspects of the system. We will see in Section 2.4 that whether two observables are compatible or 
not is very important in how we analyze a quantum mechanical system.
Not being able to measure both the S
z and Sx spin components is clearly distinct from the classi-
cal case where we can measure all three components of the spin vector, which tells us which direction 
the spin is pointing. In quantum mechanics, the incompatibility of the spin components means that we 
cannot know which direction the spin is pointing. So when we say “the spin is up,” we really mean 
only that the spin component along that one axis is up (vs. down). The quantum mechanical spin vec-
tor cannot be said to be pointing in any given direction. As is often the case, we must check our classi-
cal intuition at the door of quantum mechanics.
1.1.4 /H17039 Experiment 4
Experiment 4 is depicted in Fig. 1.6 and is a slight variation on Experiment 3. Before we get into the 
details, note a few changes in the schematic drawings. As promised, we have dropped the ket labels on 
the beams because they are redundant. We have deleted the counters on all but the last analyzer and 
instead simply blocked the unwanted beams and given the average number of atoms passing from one 
analyzer to the next. The beam blocks are shown explicitly in Fig. 1.6 but will not be shown after this to 
be consistent with the SPINS program. Note also that in Experiment 4c two output beams are combined 
as input to the following analyzer. This is simple in principle and in the SPINS program but can be 
difﬁcult in practice. The recombination of the beams must be done properly so as to avoid “disturbing” 
the beams. If you care to read more about this problem, see Feynman’s Lectures on Physics, volume 3. 
We will have more to say about the “disturbance” later in Section 2.2. For now we simply assume that 
the beams can be recombined in the proper manner.
Experiment 4a is identical to Experiment 3. In Experiment 4b, the upper beam of the second ana-
lyzer is blocked and the lower beam is sent to the third analyzer. In Experiment 4c, both beams are 
combined with our new method and sent to the third analyzer. It should be clear from our previous 
experiments that Experiment 4b has the same results as Experiment 4a. We now ask about the results of 

1.1 Stern-Gerlach Experiment 9
Experiment 4c. If we were to use classical probability analysis, then Experiment 4a would indicate that 
the probability for an atom leaving the ﬁrst analyzer to take the upper path through the second analyzer 
and then exit through the upper port of the third analyzer is 25%, where we are now referring to the total 
probability for those two steps. Likewise, Experiment 4b would indicate that the total probability to 
take the lower path through the second  analyzer and exit through the upper port of the third analyzer is 
also 25%. Hence the total probability to exit from the upper port of the third analyzer when both paths 
are available, which is Experiment 4c, would be 50%, and likewise for the exit from the lower port.
However, the quantum mechanical result in Experiment 4c is that all the atoms exit the upper 
port of the third analyzer and none exits the lower port. The atoms now appear to “remember” that 
they were initially measured to have spin up along the z-axis. By combining the two beams from 
the second analyzer, we have avoided the quantum mechanical disturbance that was evident in 
Experiments 3, 4a, and 4b. The result is now the same as Experiment 1, which means it is as if the 
second analyzer is not there.
To see how odd this is, look carefully at what happens at the lower port of the third analyzer. In 
this discussion, we refer to percentages of atoms leaving the ﬁrst analyzer, because that analyzer is 
the same in all three experiments. In Experiments 4a and 4b, 50% of the atoms are blocked after the 
middle analyzer and 25% of the atoms exit the lower port of the third analyzer. In Experiment 4c, 
100% of the atoms pass from the second analyzer to the third analyzer, yet fewer atoms come out 
of the lower port. In fact, no atoms make it through the lower port! So we have a situation where

allowing more ways or paths to reach a counter results in fewer counts. Classical probability theory 
cannot explain this aspect of quantum mechanics. It is as if you opened a second window in a room to 
get more sunlight and the room went dark!
However, you may already know of a way to explain this effect. Imagine a procedure whereby 
combining two effects leads to cancellation rather than enhancement. The concept of wave interfer-
ence, especially in optics, comes to mind. In the Young’s double-slit experiment, light waves pass 
through two narrow slits and create an interference pattern on a distant screen, as shown in Fig. 1.7. 
Either slit by itself produces a nearly uniform illumination of the screen, but the two slits combined 
produce bright and dark interference fringes, as shown in Fig. 1.7(b). We explain this by adding 
together the electric ﬁeld vectors of the light from the two slits, then squaring the resultant vector to 
ﬁnd the light intensity. We say that we add the amplitudes and then square the total amplitude to ﬁnd 
the resultant intensity. See Section 6.6 or an optics textbook for more details about this experiment.
We follow a similar prescription in quantum mechanics. We add together amplitudes and then 
take the square to ﬁnd the resultant probability, which opens the door to interference effects. Before 
we discuss quantum mechanical interference, we must explain what we mean by an amplitude in 
quantum mechanics and how we calculate it.
1.2 /H17039 QUANTUM STATE VECTORS
Postulate 1 of quantum mechanics stipulates that kets are to be used for a mathematical description of a 
quantum mechanical system. These kets are abstract entities that obey many of the rules you know about 
ordinary spatial vectors. Hence they are called quantum state vectors. As we will show in Example 1.3, 
these vectors must employ complex numbers in order to properly describe quantum mechanical systems. 
Quantum state vectors are part of a vector space that we call a Hilbert space. The dimensionality of 
the Hilbert space is determined by the physics of the system at hand. In the Stern-Gerlach example, 
the two possible results for a spin  component measurement dictate that the vector space has only two

dimensions. That makes this problem mathematically as simple as it can be, which is why we have chosen 
to study it. Because the quantum state vectors are abstract, it is hard to say much about what they are, 
other than how they behave mathematically and how they lead to physical predictions.
In the two-dimensional vector space of a spin-1/2 system, the two kets 0{9 form a basis, just like 
the unit vectors in  , jn , and kn form a basis for describing vectors in three-dimensional space. However, 
the analogy we want to make with these spatial vectors is only mathematical, not physical. The spatial 
unit vectors have three important mathematical properties that are characteristic of a basis: the basis 
vectors i
n  , jn , and kn are normalized, orthogonal, and complete. Spatial vectors are normalized if their 
magnitudes are unity, and they are orthogonal if they are geometrically perpendicular to each other. 
The basis is complete if any general vector in the space can be written as a linear superposition of the 
basis vectors. These properties of spatial basis vectors can be summarized as follows:
  in~in = jn~jn = kn ~kn = 1   normalization
  in~jn = in~kn = jn~kn = 0   orthogonality  (1.9)
  A = axin + ay jn + azkn    completeness,
where A is a general vector. Note that the dot product, also called the scalar product, is central to the 
description of these properties.
Continuing the mathematical analogy between spatial vectors and abstract vectors, we require that 
these same properties (at least conceptually) apply to quantum mechanical basis vectors. For the Sz 
measurement, there are only two possible results, corresponding to the states 0 +9 and 0 -9, so these 
two states comprise a complete set of basis vectors. This basis is known as the Sz basis. We focus on 
this basis for now and refer to other possible basis sets later. The completeness of the basis kets 0{9 
implies that a general quantum state vector 0 c9 is a linear combination of the two basis kets:
 0 c9= a 0 +9+ b 0 -9, (1.10)
where a and b are complex scalar numbers multiplying each ket. This addition of two kets yields 
another ket in the same abstract space. The complex scalar can appear either before or after the ket 
without affecting the mathematical properties of the ket 1i.e., a 0 +9= 0 +9a2. It is customary to use 
the Greek letter c (psi) for a general quantum state. You may have seen c1x2 used before as a quan-
tum mechanical wave function. However, the state vector or ket 0 c9 is not a wave function. Kets do 
not have any spatial dependence as wave functions do. We will study wave functions in Chapter 5.
To discuss orthogonality and normalization (known together as orthonormality) we must ﬁrst 
deﬁne scalar products as they apply to these new kets. As we said above, the machinery of quantum 
mechanics requires the use of complex numbers. You may have seen other ﬁelds of physics use com-
plex numbers. For example, sinusoidal oscillations can be described using the complex exponential 
eivt rather than cos(vt). However, in such cases, the complex numbers are not required, but are rather 
a convenience to make the mathematics easier. When using complex notation to describe classical 
vectors like electric and magnetic ﬁelds, the deﬁnition of the dot product is generalized slightly, such 
that one of the vectors is complex conjugated. A similar approach is taken in quantum mechanics. The 
analog to the complex conjugated vector of classical physics is called a bra in the Dirac notation of 
quantum mechanics. Thus corresponding to a general ket 0 c9, there is a bra, or bra vector, which is 
written as 8c 0. If a general ket 0 c9 is speciﬁed as 0 c9= a 0 +9+ b 0 -9, then the corresponding bra 
8c 0 is deﬁned as
 8c 0 = a*8+ 0 + b*8- 0 , (1.11)

12 Stern-Gerlach Experiments
where the basis bras 8 + 0 and 8 - 0 correspond to the basis kets 0 +9 and 0 -9, respectively, and the 
coefﬁcients a and b have been complex conjugated.
The scalar product in quantum mechanics is deﬁned as the product of a bra and a ket taken in the 
proper order—bra ﬁrst, then ket second:
 18bra 0210ket92. (1.12)
When the bra and ket are combined together in this manner, we get a bracket (bra ket)—a little physics 
humor—that is written in shorthand as
 8bra 0ket9. (1.13)
Thus, given the basis kets 0 +9 and 0 -9, one inner product, for example, is written as
 18 + 0210 - 92= 8 + 0 - 9 (1.14)
and so on. Note that we have eliminated the extra vertical bar in the middle. The scalar product in 
quantum mechanics is generally referred to as an inner product or a projection.
So how do we calculate the inner product 8+ 0 +9? We do it the same way we calculate the dot 
product in ~in . We deﬁne it to be unity because we like basis vectors to be unit vectors. There is a little 
more to it than that, because in quantum mechanics (as we will see shortly) using normalized basis 
vectors is more rooted in physics than in our personal preferences for mathematical cleanliness. But 
for all practical purposes, if someone presents a set of basis vectors to you, you can probably assume 
that they are normalized. So the normalization of the spin-1/2 basis vectors is expressed in this new 
notation as 8+ 0 +9= 1 and 8- 0 -9= 1.
Now, what about orthogonality? The spatial unit vectors in, jn, and kn  used for spatial vectors are 
orthogonal to each other because they are at 90° with respect to each other. That orthogonality is 
expressed mathematically in the dot products in~jn = in~kn = jn~kn = 0. For the spin basis kets 0 +9 and 
0 -9, there is no spatial geometry involved. Rather, the spin basis kets 0 +9 and 0 -9 are orthogonal in 
the mathematical sense, which we express with the inner product as 8+ 0 -9= 0. Again, we do not 
prove to you that these basis vectors are orthogonal, but we assume that a well-behaved basis set obeys 
orthogonality. Though there is no geometry in this property for quantum mechanical basis vectors, 
the fundamental idea of orthogonality is the same, so we use the same language—if a general vector 
“points” in the direction of a basis vector, then there is no component in the “direction” of the other 
unit vectors.
In summary, the properties of normalization, orthogonality, and completeness can be expressed 
in the case of a two-state spin-1/2 quantum system as:
 8+ 0 +9= 1
8- 0 -9= 1 r    normalization  
 8+ 0 -9= 0
8- 0 +9= 0 r    orthogonality   
(1.15)
 0 c9= a 0 +9+ b 0 -9    completeness    . 
Note that a product of kets 1e.g., 0 +90 +92 or a similar product of bras 1e.g., 8 + 08 + 02 is meaningless 
in this new notation, while a product of a ket and a bra in the “wrong” order 1e.g., 0 + 98 + 02 has a 
meaning that we will deﬁne in Section 2.2.3. Equations (1.15) are sufﬁcient to deﬁne how the basis 

1.2 Quantum State Vectors 13
kets behave mathematically. Note that the inner product is deﬁned using a bra and a ket, though it is 
common to refer to the inner product of two kets, where it is understood that one is converted to a bra 
ﬁrst. The order does matter, as we will see shortly.
Using this new notation, we can learn a little more about general quantum states and derive some 
expressions that will be useful later. Consider the general state vector 0 c9= a 0 +9+ b 0 -9. Take the 
inner product of this ket with the bra 8 + 0 and obtain
  8 + 0 c9= 8 + 0 1a 0 +9+ b 0 -92 
  = 8 + 0a 0 +9+ 8 + 0b 0 -9 (1.16)
  = a 8 + 0 +9+ b8 + 0 -9  
  = a , 
using the properties that inner products are distributive and that scalars can be moved freely through 
bras or kets. Likewise, you can show that 8- 0c9= b. Hence the coefﬁcients multiplying the basis 
kets are simply the inner products or projections of the general state 0c9 along each basis ket, albeit in 
an abstract complex vector space rather than the concrete three-dimensional space of normal vectors. 
Using these results, we rewrite the general state as
  0 c9= a 0 +9+ b 0 -9  
  = 0 +9a + 0 -9b  (1.17)
  = 0 +958 + 0 c96 + 0 -958 - 0 c96, 
where the rearrangement of the second equation again uses the property that scalars 1e.g., a = 8 + 0 c92 
can be moved through bras or kets.
For a general state vector 0 c9= a 0 +9+ b 0 -9, we deﬁned the corresponding bra to be 
8c 0 = a*8 + 0 +b*8 - 0. Thus, the inner product of the state 0 c9 with the basis ket 0 +9 taken in the 
reverse order compared to Eq. (1.16) yields
  8c 0 + 9= 8 + 0a* 0 +9+ 8 - 0b* 0 +9 
  = a*8 + 0 + 9+ b*8 - 0 +9 
  = a*.  
(1.18)
Thus, we see that an inner product with the states reversed results in a complex conjugation of the 
inner product:
 8 + 0 c 9= 8c 0 +9*. (1.19)
This important property holds for any inner product. For example, the inner product of two general 
states is
 8f0 c9= 8c 0f 9*  . (1.20)
Now we come to a new mathematical aspect of quantum vectors that differs from the use of vec-
tors in classical mechanics. The rules of quantum mechanics (postulate 1) require that all state vectors 
describing a quantum system be normalized, not just the basis kets. This is clearly different from 
ordinary spatial vectors, where the length or magnitude of a vector means something and only the unit 
vectors i
n, jn, and kn  are normalized to unity. This new rule means that in the quantum mechanical state 

14 Stern-Gerlach Experiments
space only the direction—in an abstract sense—is important. If we apply this normalization require-
ment to a general state 0 c9, then we obtain
 8c 0 c9= 5a*8 + 0 + b*8- 065a 0 +9+ b 0 -96 = 1 
  1 a*a 8+ 0 +9+ a*b 8+ 0 -9+ b*a 8 - 0 +9+ b*b 8 - 0 -9= 1
  1 a*a + b*b = 1  
(1.21)
  1 0a 0

= 1 ,
or using the expressions for the coefﬁcients obtained above,
 08 + 0 c90
2
+ 08 - 0 c90
2
= 1. (1.22)
Example 1.1 Normalize the vector 0 c9= C11 0 +9+ 2i 0 -92. The complex constant C is often 
referred to as the normalization constant.
To normalize 0 c9, we set the inner product of the vector with itself equal to unity and then 
solve for C—note the requisite complex conjugations
  1 = 8c 0 c9  
  = C*518 + 0 - 2i8- 06C51 0 +9+ 2i 0 - 96  
  = C*C518 + 0 +9+ 2i8 + 0 -9- 2i8- 0 +9+ 48 - 0 -96 (1.23)
  = 5 0C 0
2
 
  1 0C 0 = 1
25
 . 
The overall phase of the normalization constant is not physically meaningful (Problem 1.3), so 
we follow the standard convention and choose it to be real and positive. This yields C = 1>15. 
The normalized quantum state vector is then
 0 c9= 1
25
 11 0 +9+ 2i 0 -92. (1.24)
Now comes the crucial element of quantum mechanics.  We postulate that each term in the sum 
of Eq. (1.22) is equal to the probability that the quantum state described by the ket 0 c9 is measured 
to be in the corresponding basis state. Thus
 PSz = + U>2 = 08+ 0 c90
2
 (1.25)
is the probability that the state 0 c9 is found to be in the state 0 +9 when a measurement of Sz is made, 
meaning that the result Sz = +U>2 is obtained. Likewise,
 PSz = - U>2 = 08- 0 c90
2
 (1.26)
is the probability that the measurement yields the result Sz = -U>2. The subscript on the probability 
indicates the measured value. For the spin component measurements, we will usually abbreviate this 
to, for example, P
+  for an Sz = +U>2 result or P- y for an Sy = -U>2 measurement.

1.2 Quantum State Vectors 15
We now have a prescription for predicting the outcomes of the experiments we have been dis-
cussing. For example, the experiment shown in Fig. 1.8 has the state 0 c9= 0 +9 prepared by the 
ﬁrst Stern-Gerlach device and then input to the second Stern-Gerlach device aligned along the z-axis. 
Therefore the probabilities of measuring the input state 0 c9= 0 +9 to have the two output values are 
as shown. Because the spin-1/2 system has only two possible measurement results, these two prob-
abilities must sum to unity—there is a 100% probability of recording some value in the experiment. 
This basic rule of probabilities is why the rules of quantum mechanics require that all state vectors 
be properly normalized before they are used in any calculation of probabilities. The experimental 
predictions shown in Fig. 1.8 are an example of the fourth postulate of quantum mechanics, which is 
presented below.

FIGURE 1.8 Probabilities of spin component measurements.
Postulate 4 (Spin-1/2 system)
The probability of obtaining the value {U>2 in a measurement of the observ-
able Sz on a system in the state 0 c9 is
P{ = 08{ 0 c90
2
,
where 0{9 is the basis ket of Sz corresponding to the result {U>2.
This is labeled as the fourth postulate because we have written this postulate using the language of the 
spin-1/2 system, while the general statement of the fourth postulate presented in Section 1.5 requires 
the second and third postulates of Section 2.1. A general spin component measurement is shown in 
Fig. 1.9, along with a histogram that compactly summarizes the measurement results.
Because the quantum mechanical probability is found by squaring an inner product, we refer to 
an inner product, 8+ 0 c9 for example, as a probability amplitude or sometimes just an amplitude; 
much like a classical wave intensity is found by squaring the wave amplitude. Note that the conven-
tion is to put the input or initial state on the right and the output or ﬁnal state on the left: 8out 0in9, so 
one would read from right to left in describing a problem. Because the probability involves the com-
plex square of the amplitude, and 8out 0in9= 8in 0out9*, this convention is not critical for calculat-
ing probabilities. Nonetheless, it is the accepted practice and is important in situations where several 
amplitudes are combined.
Armed with these new quantum mechanical rules and tools, let’s continue to analyze the experi-
ments discussed earlier. Using the experimental results and the new rules we have introduced, we can 
learn more about the mathematical behavior of the kets and the relationships among them. We will 
focus on the ﬁrst two experiments for now and return to the others in the next chapter.

16 Stern-Gerlach Experiments
1.2.1 /H17039 Analysis of Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, the ﬁrst Stern-Gerlach analyzer prepared the system in the 0 +9 state and the sec-
ond analyzer later measured this state to be in the 0 +9 state and not in the 0 -9 state. The results of 
the experiment are summarized in the histogram in Fig. 1.10. We can use the fourth postulate to pre-
dict the results of this experiment. We take the inner product of the input state 0 +9 with each of the 
possible output basis states 0 +9 and 0 -9. Because we know that the basis states are normalized and 
orthogonal, we calculate the probabilities to be
 P+ = 08+ 0 +90
2
= 1 
 P- = 08 - 0 +90
2
= 0 .  
(1.27)
These predictions agree exactly with the histogram of experimental results shown in Fig. 1.10. A 0 +9 
state is always measured to have Sz = +U>2.
1.2.2 /H17039 Analysis of Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, the ﬁrst Stern-Gerlach analyzer prepared the system in the 0 +9 state and the sec-
ond analyzer performed a measurement of the spin component along the x-axis, ﬁnding 50% prob-
abilities for each of the two possible states 0 +9x and 0 -9x, as shown in the histogram in Fig. 1.11(a). 
For this experiment, we cannot predict the results of the measurements, because we do not yet have

1.2 Quantum State Vectors 17
enough information about how the states 0 +9x and 0 -9x behave mathematically. Rather, we will use 
the results of the experiment to determine these states. Recalling that the experimental results would 
be the same if the ﬁrst analyzer prepared the system to be in the 
0 -9 state [see Fig. 1.11(b)], we have 
four results for the two experiments:
 P1, + x = 0x8+ 0 +90
2
= 1
2  
 P1, - x = 0x8 - 0 +90
2

2
= 1
2   
(1.28)
 P2, - x = 0x8 - 0 -90
2
= 1
2 . 
Because the kets 0 +9 and 0 -9 form a complete basis, the kets describing the Sx measurement, 0 +9x 
and 0 -9x, can be written in terms of them. We do not yet know the speciﬁc coefﬁcients of the 0{9x 
states, so we use general expressions
 0 +9x = a 0 +9+ b 0 -9 
 0 -9x = c 0 +9+ d 0 -9, 
(1.29)
and now our task is to use the results of Experiment 2 to determine the coefﬁcients a, b, c, and d. The 
ﬁrst measured probability in Eq. (1.28) is
 P1, + x = 0x8+ 0 +90
2
= 1
2 . (1.30)
Using the general expression for 0 +9x in Eq. (1.29), we calculate the probability that the 0 +9 input 
state is measured to be in the 0 +9x output state, that is, to have Sx = +U>2:
  P1, + x = 0x8+ 0 +90

where we convert the 0 +9x ket to a bra x8 + 0 in order to calculate the inner product. Equating the 
experimental result in Eq. (1.30) and the prediction in Eq. (1.31), we ﬁnd

2 . (Prob-
lem 1.4) Because each coefﬁcient is complex, each has an amplitude and phase. However, the overall 
phase of a quantum state vector is not physically meaningful (see Problem 1.3). Only the relative 
phase between different components of the state vector is physically measurable. Hence, we are free to 
choose one coefﬁcient of each vector to be real and positive without any loss of generality. This allows 
us to write the desired states as
  
0 +9x = 1
12 30 +9+ eia0 -94  
  0 -9x = 1
12 30 +9+ eib0 -94,
  (1.33)
where a and b are relative phases that we have yet to determine. Note that these states are already nor-
malized because we used all of the experimental results, which reﬂect the fact that the probability for 
all possible results of an experiment must sum to unity.
We have used all the experimental results from Experiment 2, but the 0{9x kets are still not deter-
mined. We need some more information. If we perform Experiment 1 with both analyzers aligned 
along the x-axis, the results will be as you expect—all 0 +9x states from the ﬁrst analyzer will be mea-
sured to have Sx = +U>2 at the second analyzer, that is, all atoms exit in the 0 +9x state and none in the 
0 -9x . The probability calculations for this experiment are
 P+ x = 0x8+ 0 +9x 0
2
= 1 
 P- x = 0x8 - 0 +9x 0
2
= 0,  
(1.34)
which tell us mathematically that the 0{9x states are orthonormal to each other, just like the 0{9 
states. This also implies that the 0{9x kets form a basis, the Sx basis, which you might expect because 
they correspond to the distinct results of a different spin component measurement. The general expres-
sions we used for the 0{9x kets are already normalized but are not yet orthogonal. That is the new 
piece of information we need. The orthogonality condition leads to
 x8 - 0 +9x = 0

2 31 + ei1a- b24= 0  (1.35)
 ei1a- b2 = -1 
 eia = -eib, 
where the complex conjugation of the second coefﬁcient of the x8 - 0 bra should be noted.
We now have an equation relating the remaining coefﬁcients a and b, but we need some more 
information to determine their values. Unfortunately, there is no more information to be obtained, so 
we are free to choose the value of the phase a. This freedom comes from the fact that we have required 
only that the x-axis be perpendicular to the z-axis, which limits the x-axis only to a plane rather than to 
a unique direction. We follow convention here and choose the phase a /H11005 0. Thus we can express the 
Sx basis kets in terms of the Sz basis kets as
  0 +9x = 1
12 30 +9+ 0 -94 
  0 -9x = 1
12 30 +9- 0 -94.  
(1.36)

1.2 Quantum State Vectors 19
We generally use the Sz basis as the preferred basis for writing general states, but we could use 
any basis we choose. If we were to use the Sx basis, then we could write the 0{9 kets as general states 
in terms of the 0{9x kets. This can be done by solving Eq. (1.36) for the 0{9 kets, yielding
  0 +9= 1
12 30 +9x + 0 -9x4 
  0 -9= 1
12 30 +9x - 0 -9x4.  
(1.37)
With respect to the measurements performed in Experiment 2, Eq. (1.37) tells us that the 0 +9 
state is a combination of the states 0 +9x and 0 -9x. The coefﬁcients tell us that there is a 50% probabil-
ity for measuring the spin component to be up along the x-axis, and likewise for the down possibility, 
which is in agreement with the histogram of measurements shown in Fig. 1.11(a). We must now take 
a moment to describe carefully what a combination of states, such as in Eqs. (1.36) and (1.37), is and 
what it is not.
1.2.3 /H17039 Superposition States
A general spin-1/2 state vector 0 c9 can be expressed as a combination of the basis kets 0 +9 and 0 -9
 0 c9= a 0 +9+ b 0 -9. (1.38)
We refer to such a combination of states as a superposition state. To understand the importance of a 
quantum mechanical superposition state, consider the particular state
 0 c9= 1
12 10 +9+ 0 -92 (1.39)
and measurements on this state, as shown in Fig. 1.12(a). Note that the state 0 c9 is none other 
than the state 0 +9x that we found in Eq. (1.36), so we already know what the measurement results 
are. If we measure the spin component along the x-axis for this state, then we record the result 
Sx = +U>2 with 100% probability (Experiment 1 with both analyzers along the x-axis). If we mea-
sure the spin component along the orthogonal z-axis, then we record the two results Sz = {U>2 
with 50% probability each (Experiment 2 with the ﬁrst and second analyzers along the x- and 
z-axes, respectively). Based upon this second set of results, one might be tempted to consider the 
state 0 c9 as describing a beam that contains a mixture of atoms with 50% of the atoms in the 0 +9 
state and 50% in the 0 -9 state. Such a state is called a mixed state  and is very different from a 
superposition state.
To clarify the difference between a mixed state and a superposition state, let’s carefully exam-
ine the results of experiments on the proposed mixed-state beam, as shown in Fig. 1.12(b). If 
we measure the spin component along the z-axis, then each atom in the 0 +9 state yields the result 
Sz = +U>2 with 100% certainty and each atom in the 0 -9 state yields the result Sz = -U>2 with 
100% certainty. The net result is that 50% of the atoms yield Sz = +U>2 and 50% yield Sz = -U>2. 
This is exactly the same result as that obtained with all atoms in the 0 +9x state, as seen in Fig. 1.12(a). 
If we instead measure the spin component along the x-axis, then each atom in the 0 +9 state yields the 
two results Sx = {U>2 with 50% probability each (Experiment 2 with the ﬁrst and second analyzers 
along the z- and x-axes, respectively). The atoms in the 0 -9 state yield the same results. The net result 
is that 50% of the atoms yield Sx = +U>2 and 50% yield Sx = -U>2. This is in stark contrast to the 
results of Experiment 1, which tell us that once we have prepared the state to be 0 +9x, then subsequent 
measurements yield Sx = +U>2 with certainty, as seen in Fig. 1.12(a).

20 Stern-Gerlach Experiments
Hence we must conclude that the system described by the 0 c9= 0 +9x state is not a mixed 
state with some atoms in the 0 +9 state and some in the 0 -9 state. Rather, each atom in the 0 +9x 
beam is in a state that itself is a superposition of the 0 +9 and 0 -9 states. A superposition state is 
often called a coherent superposition  because the relative phase of the two terms is important. For 
example, if the input beam were in the 0 -9x state, then there would be a relative minus sign between 
the two coefﬁcients, which would result in an Sx = -U>2 measurement but would not affect the Sz 
measurement.

1.2 Quantum State Vectors 21
We will not have any further need to speak of mixed states, so any combination of states we use 
is a superposition state. Note that we cannot even write down a ket describing a mixed state. So if 
 someone gives you a quantum state written as a ket, then it must be a superposition state and not a 
mixed state. The random option in the SPINS program produces a mixed state, while the unknown 
states are all superposition states.
Example 1.2 Consider the input state
 0cin9= 3 0 +9+ 4 0 -9.  (1.40)
Normalize this state vector and ﬁnd the probabilities of measuring the spin component along the 
z-axis to be Sz = {U>2.
To normalize this state, introduce an overall complex multiplicative factor and solve for this 
factor by imposing the normalization condition:
 0cin9= C 33 0 +9+ 4 0 -94  
 8cin 0cin9= 1 
 5C* 338 + 0+ 48 - 0465C 33 0 +9+ 4 0 -946 = 1 
(1.41) C*C 398 + 0 +9+ 128 + 0 -9+ 128 - 0 +9+ 168 - 0 -94 = 1 
 C*C 3254= 1 
 0C 0
2
= 1
25 . 
Because an overall phase is physically meaningless, we choose C to be real and positive: C = 1>5. 
Hence the normalized input state is
 @cin9= 3
5 @ + 9+ 4
5 @ -9. (1.42)

Note that the two probabilities add to unity, which indicates that we normalized the input state 
properly. A histogram of the predicted measurement results is shown in Fig. 1.13.
 1.3 /H17039 MATRIX NOTATION
Up to this point, we have deﬁned kets mathematically in terms of their inner products with other kets. 
Thus, in the general case we write a ket as
 0 c9= 8+ 0 c90 +9+ 8 - 0 c90 -9, (1.45)
or in a speciﬁc case, we write
  0 +9x = 8+ 0 +9x 0 +9+ 8 - 0 +9x 0 -9 
  = 1
12 0 +9+ 1
12 0 -9.  
(1.46)
In both of these cases, we have chosen to write the kets in terms of the 0 +9 and 0 -9 basis kets. If we 
agree on that choice of basis as a convention, then the two coefﬁcients 8+ 0 +9x and 8 - 0 +9x uniquely 
specify the quantum state, and we can simplify the notation by using just those numbers. Thus, we 
represent a ket as a column vector containing the two coefﬁcients that multiply each basis ket. For 
example, we represent 0 +9x as
 0 +9x /H110391
22
 ¢1
1≤ , (1.47)
where we have used the new symbol /H11039to signify “is represented by,” and it is understood that we 
are using the 0 +9 and 0 -9 basis or the Sz basis. We cannot say that the ket equals the column vector, 
because the ket is an abstract vector in the state space and the column vector is just two complex num-
bers. If we were to choose a different basis for representing the vector, then the complex coefﬁcients 
would be different even though the vector is unchanged. We need to have a convention for the order-
ing of the amplitudes in the column vector. The standard convention is to put the spin up amplitude 
ﬁrst (at the top). Thus, the representation of the 0 -9x state in Eq. (1.36) is
 0 -9x /H110391

1.3 Matrix Notation 23
where we have explicitly labeled the rows according to their corresponding basis kets. Using this con-
vention, it should be clear that the basis kets themselves are written as
 0 +9/H11039a1
0b 
 0 -9/H11039a0
1b.  
(1.49)
This demonstrates the important feature that basis kets are unit vectors when written in their own basis.
This new way of expressing a ket simply as the collection of coefﬁcients that multiply the basis 
kets is referred to as a representation. Because we have assumed the Sz kets as the basis kets, this is 
called the Sz representation. It is always true that basis kets have the simple form shown in Eq. (1.49) 
when written in their own representation. A general ket 0 c9 is written as
 0 c9/H11039¢8+ 0 c9
8- 0 c9≤. (1.50)
This use of matrix notation simpliﬁes the mathematics of bras and kets. The advantage is not so evident for 
the simple two-dimensional state space of spin-1/2 systems, but it is very evident for larger dimensional 
problems. This notation is indispensable when using computers to calculate quantum mechanical results. 
For example, the SPINS program employs matrix calculations coded in the Java computer language to 
simulate the Stern-Gerlach experiments using the same probability rules you are learning here.
We saw earlier [Eq. (1.11)] that the coefﬁcients of a bra are the complex conjugates of the coef-
ﬁcients of the corresponding ket. We also know that an inner product of a bra and a ket yields a single 
complex number. In order for the matrix rules of multiplication to be used, a bra must be represented 
by a row vector, with the entries being the coefﬁcients ordered in the same sense as for the ket. For 
example, if we use the general ket
 
0 c9= a 0 +9+ b 0 -9, (1.51)
which is represented as
 0 c9/H11039aa
bb, (1.52)
then the corresponding bra
 8c 0 = a*8 + 0 + b*8 - 0 (1.53)
is represented by a row vector as
 8c 0 /H110391a* b*2. (1.54)
The rules of matrix algebra can then be applied to ﬁnd an inner product. For example,
  8c 0 c9= 1a* b*2aa
bb 
  = 0a 0
2
+ 0b 0
2
.  
(1.55)
So a bra is represented by a row vector that is the complex conjugate and transpose of the column vec-
tor representing the corresponding ket.

Example 1.3 To get some practice using this new matrix notation, and to learn some more about 
the spin-1/2 system, use the results of Experiment 2 to determine the Sy basis kets using the matrix 
approach instead of the Dirac bra-ket approach.
Consider Experiment 2 in the case where the second Stern-Gerlach analyzer is aligned along 
the y-axis. We said before that the results are the same as in the case shown in Fig. 1.4. Thus, we 
have
  P1, + y = @y8+ @ +9@
2
= 1
2  
  P1, - y = @y8- @ +9@
2
= 1

  P2, + y = @y8+ @ -9@

(1.56)
  P2, - y = @y8- @ -9@

= 1
2 , 
as depicted in the histograms of Fig. 1.14.
These results allow us to determine the kets 0{9y corresponding to the spin component up and 
down along the y-axis. The argument and calculation proceeds exactly as it did earlier for the 0{9x 
states up until the point [Eq. (1.35)] where we arbitrarily chose the phase a to be zero. Having done 
that for the 0{9x states, we are no longer free to make that same choice for the 0{9y states. Thus 
we use Eq. (1.35) to write the 0{9y states as
  0 +9y = 1

(1.57)
To determine the phase a, we use some more information at our disposal. Experiment 2 could be 
performed with the ﬁrst Stern-Gerlach analyzer aligned along the x-axis and the second analyzer 
along the y-axis. Again the results would be identical (50% at each output port), yielding

  = 1
4 11 + eia + e-ia + 12  
  = 1
2 11 + cos a2= 1
2 . 
This result requires that cos a = 0, or that a = {p>2. The two choices for the phase correspond 
to the two possibilities for the direction of the y-axis relative to the already determined x- and z-axes. 
The choice a = +p>2 can be shown to correspond to a right-handed coordinate system, which is the 
standard convention, so we choose that phase. We thus represent the 0{9y kets as
  0 +9y /H110391
22
 a1
i b  
  0 -9y /H110391
22

(1.60)
Note that the imaginary components of these kets are required. They are not merely a mathemati-
cal convenience as one sees in classical mechanics. In general, quantum mechanical state vectors 
have complex coefﬁcients. But this does not mean that the results of physical measurements are 
complex. On the contrary, we always calculate a measurement probability using a complex square, 
so all quantum mechanics predictions of probabilities are real.
 1.4 /H17039 GENERAL QUANTUM SYSTEMS
The machinery we have developed for spin-1/2 systems can be generalized to other quantum systems. 
For example, if an observable A yields quantized measurement results an for some ﬁnite range of n, 
then we generalize the schematic depiction of a Stern-Gerlach measurement to a measurement of the 
A

observable A, as shown in Fig. 1.15. The observable A labels the measurement device and the possible 
results a1, a2, a3, etc. label the output ports. The basis kets corresponding to the results an are then 0an9. 
The mathematical rules about kets in this general case are
  8ai @aj9= dij         orthonormality 
  0 c9= a

8ai 0 c90ai9  completeness,  
(1.61)
where we use the Kronecker delta
 dij = e0
1 i /H11014j
i = j (1.62)
to express the orthonormality condition compactly. In this case, the generalization of postulate 4 says 
that the probability of a measurement of one of the possible results an is
 Pan = 08an 0cin90

.  (1.63)
Example 1.4 Imagine a quantum system with an observable A that has three possible measure-
ment results: a1, a2, and a3. The three kets 0a19, 0a29, and 0a39 corresponding to these possible 
results form a complete orthonormal basis. The system is prepared in the state
 0 c9= 2 0a19- 3 0a29+ 4i 0a39. (1.64)
Calculate the probabilities of all possible measurement results of the observable A.
The state vector in Eq. (1.64) is not normalized, so we must normalize it before calculating 
probabilities. Introducing a complex normalization constant C, we ﬁnd
  1 = 8c 0 c9  
  = C*128a1 0 - 38a2 0 - 4i8a3 02C12 0a19- 3 0a29+ 4i 0a392
